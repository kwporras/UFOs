# UFOs

## Overview of Project: UFO's

We'll explore JavaScript as a front-end development language to brings extra functionality and customization and build a dynamic webpage. This will allow user inputs and visually adjust their search and reflect their interaction. CSS, Bootstrap, and Chrome dev tools will be utilized to build a table which holds and display the webpage data. The added filters will let users refine their search and provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings for multiple criteria at the same time.  


## Results:
Below shows how a user could use each of the search criteria to filter down to the webpage data.

## Summary: Design limitations
A major design flaw of the filter table is the limited acceptable character input format for each filter.
A temporary solution would be to add a legend describing the required input format for each filter such as capitalization.
The more in-depth solution would be to include more flexible code which accepts different formats a user may input into each desired filter field.
